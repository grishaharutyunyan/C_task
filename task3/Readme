Project Overview:
1. Stack Implementation:

The project defines a stack structure (myStack) using a dynamic array to store elements.
The stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
2. Stack Operations:

Initialization: 
The stack is initialized with an initial capacity.
Push Operation: Adds an element to the top of the stack. 
The stack dynamically resizes if the capacity is exceeded.
Pop Operation: 
Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack. 
Handles underflow conditions.

Peek Operation: Returns the top element without removing it.

Size Function:Returns the current number of elements in the stack.

Capacity Function: Returns the current capacity of the stack.

Print Stack Function: Displays the elements of the stack.

3. User Interface (Menu-Driven): I decided to add a menu to make it easier to use

A user menu allows users to perform various operations on the stack.
Menu options include push, pop, peek, print stack, check size, check capacity, and exit.
4. Input Validation:

The program validates user input to ensure it is a valid integer where necessary.
Error messages are displayed for invalid input, guiding the user to enter correct values.

5. Memory Management:

Memory is dynamically allocated for the stack structure and array.
Proper memory deallocation is performed when the program exits.

How to Use:
Users can interact with the stack by choosing options from the menu.
The program provides feedback on the performed operations, such as pushing/popping elements and displaying the stack status.

Potential Improvements (Optional):
Additional features, such as error handling during stack resizing or advanced memory management, could be implemented.
Unit tests could be developed to ensure the correctness of stack operations.
Conclusion:
This project serves as a foundation for a simple stack implementation in C, providing users with a practical understanding of stack operations and dynamic memory allocation. It includes a user interface for easy interaction with the stack functionalities.
